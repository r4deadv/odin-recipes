    <h2>What Is a Sloppy Joe?</h2>
    <p>
      A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a
      tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According
      to legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe.

      You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief
      overview of what you can expect when you make these classic Sloppy Joes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the beef, onion, and green pepper.</li>
      <li>Drain the liquids, then stir in the remaining ingredients.</li>
      <li>Simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
      <li>¾ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef
          in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4
          minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables
          have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with
          salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</p>

    </ol>

    <h2>Recipe Tip</h2>
    <p>
      If using ground beef with a higher fat content than lean, be sure to drain
      any fat before starting Step 2.
